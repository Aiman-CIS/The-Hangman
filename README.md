# The-Hangman
This Python code implements Hangman, a word-guessing game. It randomly selects a word from a list, allowing the player to guess one letter at a time. With six attempts, the player must correctly guess the word. The code tracks guessed letters, displays progress, and provides feedback. Enjoy the challenge!!
